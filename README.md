# DataStax Java Driver for Apache Cassandra - Examples

This module contains examples of how to use the DataStax Java driver for
Apache Cassandra.

This is a partial copy of the datastax driver examples just using writing to a blob.  This is the original code by Andy Tolbert (sorry for the thievery Andy!)
git@github.com:datastax/java-driver.git

## Usage

Unless otherwise stated, this example is currently hardcoded to be used with azure with host names such as dc0vm0, dc0mv1, etc.   This code has been running on the opscenter node that is created as part of the standard template of azure.
